# DeepFaceLab_MP
DeepFaceLab on Mutilplue plantforms

## Intro

This project provides scripts inspired by [DeepFaceLab_Linux](https://github.com/lbfs/DeepFaceLab_Linux) and [DeepFaceLab_MacOS](https://github.com/lbfs/DeepFaceLab_Linux) to setup and run [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab) on any operation system (except windows).

You'll need `git`, `ffmpeg` and `anaconda` available to execute these scripts. The scripts will create a conda env sandbox and will install all necessary dependencies there.
